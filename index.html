        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jericho and I'm a student developer who started coding because I wanted to build cool, useful, and fun things that help people. I’ve explored game development, web apps, AI tools, automation, and now I’m creating real-world systems and apps that schools and students can use. PrepSet was inspired by watching students struggle with college decision-making, essays, interviews, and long-term planning — so I built something that gives smart, personalized help for all of it.
